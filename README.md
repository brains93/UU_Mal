# UU_Mal

## Instructions
Simple get this code to run on a windows machine with Microsoft defender or other AV on it. 
the Shell code is the malicous payload and needs to be pulled into the script in some way without changing the content, this does not mean you cannot change the format of it

the try expect statment is meant to escape to print (This is rocking) if it does not then you have just installed a backdoor so don't try to fix those errors 

The shell code is defanged so it should never call back but better safe than sorry 

### Your aim is to get the code to run to print (This is rocking) and ("congrats Im a hidden malware") without being flagged by AV software
